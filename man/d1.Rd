\title{Return the control points of the bezier curve, path and starting information that would be used to draw the gesture D1.}
\usage{
d1(xStart, yStart, headingStart, method = "bezier")
}
\arguments{
\item{xStart}{The start position of the x-coordinate. Valid x-coordinates must be a number with decimal of 0.5.}

\item{yStart}{The start position of the y-coordinate. Valid y-coordinates must be a number with decimal of 0.5.}

\item{headingStart}{The start orientation of the gesture. Valid headings or orientations are 90째, 180째, 270째 and 360째.}
}
\value{
A list with the starting information (x- and y-coordinate, initial orientation), the path and the control points.
}
\description{
\code{d1} This function returns the points of the path and the exact control points that would be used to draw the series of line segments for the bezier curve. The control points capture the shape of the gesture. The function draws a diagonal gesture.
}
\examples{
d1(xStart = 0.5, yStart = 1.5, headingStart = 90)
